## LEARNING THAT OCCURED AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED
### Heading syntax requires a space.

> #### `####` The Heading
> #### -not-
> #### `####`The Heading

### `#` Comes with a horizontal line in Markdown
> Reference the Heading at the top of the page.

### Headings have inherent soft breaks.
> While creating navigational components for Reading Notes I discovered visual annoyances that I would have normally fixed with a soft break.  Soft breaks seem to be recognized as white space and no `<br>` command seems to exist for Markdown.  I have created a visual situation I am happy with by introducing heading formatting to this content.  Putting `>` in an otherwise empty line visually fills in missing background formatting.  `<br>` without seems to work in live Pages when GitHub converts a .md to an .html file for Pages.

## PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TIMED OUT BEFORE RESOLUTION

### This is one paragraph.
> I cannot figure out how to get Markdown to allow a soft break in a paragraph.  A single break has no effect on formatting at all and allows words and sentences to continue wrapping in a paragraph.  A hard break creates a space but also breaks things like shading in blockquotes.

### This is three seperate sentences with a soft break inbetween.
