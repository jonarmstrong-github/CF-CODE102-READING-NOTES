## LEARNING THAT OCCURED AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED
### Heading syntax requires a space.

> #### `####` The Heading
> #### -not-
> #### `####`The Heading

### `#` Comes with a horizontal line in Markdown
> Reference the Heading at the top of the page.

### Headings have inherent soft breaks.
> While creating navigational components for Reading Notes I discovered visual annoyances that I would have normally fixed with a soft break.  Soft breaks seem to be recognized as white space and no `<br>` command seems to exist for Markdown.  I have created a visual situation I am happy with by introducing heading formatting to this content.  Putting `>` in an otherwise empty line visually fills in missing background formatting.  `<br>` without seems to work in live Pages when GitHub converts a .md to an .html file for Pages.

## PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TIMED OUT BEFORE RESOLUTION

### Horizontal spacing and background formatting
> I cannot figure out how to get Markdown to allow a soft break in a paragraph.  A single break has no effect on formatting at all and allows words and sentences to continue wrapping in a paragraph.  A hard break creates a space but also breaks things like shading in blockquotes.Headings have inherent attributes that manipulate line spacing.

    The text above was one paragraph but this copy below is three seperate sentences with soft breaks inbetween.

    These indented bit also seem to have their own inherent horizontal spacing properties.  ðŸ˜’
