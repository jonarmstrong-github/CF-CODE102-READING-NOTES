## AGENDA
1. Review of previous class
    - Share your learning

    - Robot Exercise
    - Discussion Reading
1. Demo With JavaScript Functions
    - Lab: Refactoring

## NOTES
### Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function. Parameters are initialized to the values of the arguments supplied.

### So many operators
    JavaScript has the following types of operators and they get complex. 

    Assignment operators
    Comparison operators
    Arithmetic operators
    Bitwise operators
    Logical operators
    String operators
    Conditional (ternary) operator
    Comma operator
    Unary operators
    Relational operators

## VOCABULAY
Script - a sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program.

Programmatic problem solving - I'm guessing: is it using programs to solve problems?

Expression - any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Operator - used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.  This is a big deal.

Function - a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

Declaration - how variables are created

Call - invokes a function

Parameters - the arguments of a function

Arguments - an object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.

Return value - when a value from a function back is passed back to the code that called it by using the return statement.

Refactoring - the process of changing a piece of code without altering how it works

## LEARNING THAT OCCURED AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED
