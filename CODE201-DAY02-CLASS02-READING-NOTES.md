# READING NOTES
## HTML/CSS Chapter 2: “Text” (pp.40-61)
HTML MARKUP IS STRUCTURAL (HEADING, PARAGRAPH)
SEMANTIC - EXTRA INFO

HEADINGS ```<H1> - <H6>```

PARAGRAPHS ```<P></P>``` - CREATE A NEW LINE

BOLD ```<B></B>``` OR STRONG (PREFERRED) ```<STRONG></STRONG>```

ITALIC ```<I></I>``` OR EMPHASIS (PREFERRED) ```<EM></EM>```

SUPERSCRIPT ```<SUP></SUP>```

SUBSCRIPT ```<SUB></SUB>```

HTML IS WHITE SPACE COLLAPSING.  ONLY A SINGLE SPACE IS DISPLACED NO MANY HOW MANY ARE OBSERVED.

LINE BREAK ```<BR/>```  IT IS CONSIDERED A BEST PRACTICE TO PUT A ```/``` ON A SOLO (EMPTY) ELEMENT.

HORIZONTAL RULE ```<HR/>```  IT IS CONSIDERED A BEST PRACTICE TO PUT A ```/``` ON A SOLO (EMPTY) ELEMENT.

MORE SEMANTIC MARKUP FOR SCREEN READERS AND SEARCH ENGINES (NOT JUST FOR APPEARANCE)

EMPHASIS ```<EM></EM>```

BLOCKQUOTE ```<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>```

STRONG ```<STRONG></STRONG>```

QUOTE ```<Q></Q>```

ABBREVIATIONS ```<ABBR TITLE=""></ABBR>```

AND MANY MORE......


## HTML/CSS Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)
AN INVISIBLE BOX AROUND EVERYTHING

```SELECTOR {```

```DECLARATION: DECARE;```  (PROPERTY: VALUE;)

```}```

EXTERNAL CSS

```<LINK HREF="./" TYPE="TEXT/CSS" REL="STYLESHEET"/>```

CSS SELECTORS PAGE 237-238

## JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS OR STATEMENTS.

A STATEMENT IS A LINE OF CODE AND SHOULD END IN ";" IN JAVASCRIPT.

```{}``` DEFINE A CODE BLOCK.

```*/``` WRITE MULTI-LINE COMMENTS.

```//``` WRITE SINGLE LINE OR INLINE COMMENTS.

VARIABLES STORE DATA

```LET VARIABLE;```

```CONST VARIABLE;```

~~```VAR VARIABLE;```~~  (ANTIQUATED)

VARIABLE = A NUMBER, STRING, BOOLEAN, ARRAY, OBJECT, UNDEFINED, NULL

= IS AN ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR HERE

## JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
EVALUATIONS, DECISIONS, AND LOOPS HELP GUIDE THE FLOW OF DATA.

FLOWCHARTS CAN HELP YOU DESIGN THE FLOW OF CODE.

THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS TO A DECISION.
1. AN EXPRESSION IS EVALUATED, WHICH RETURNS A VALUE.
1. A CONDITIONAL STATEMENT SAYS WHAT TO DO IN A GIVEN SITUATION.

EVALUATING CONDITIONS WITH COMPARISON OPERATORS

```==``` IS EQUAL TO

```!=``` IS NOT EQUAL TO

```===``` STRICTLY EQUAL TO

```!==``` STRICTLY NOT EQUAL TO

```>``` GREATER THAN

```<``` LESS THAN

```>=``` GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO

```<=``` LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO

```(OPERAND >= OPERAND)``` TWO OPERANDS WITH A COMPARISON OPERATOR IN BETWEEN.

EVALUATING CONDITIONS WITH LOGICAL OPERATORS
