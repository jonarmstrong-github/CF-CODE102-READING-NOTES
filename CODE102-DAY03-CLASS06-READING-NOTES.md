## AGENDA
1. Review of previous class
    - Share your learning
1. JavaScript
    - Recap from Code 101
    - Discussion Exercise
1. From Mockup to Markup
    - Demo: Input and Output
    - Lab: Plan and Build

## NOTES
### Java and Java Script are not the same!!

### I have deduced from the videos in the link below that the original computing architechs were automotive technicians.  Input, store, process, output is identical to the process of internal combustion: suck, squeeze, bang, blow.

### Java Script Conditions and If Statements

    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b
    Equal to a == b
    Not Equal to: a != b

    `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
    `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
    `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

### Javascript understands operators
    Basic Operators
    + — Addition
    - — Subtraction
    * — Multiplication
    / — Division
    (...) — Grouping operator, operations within brackets are executed earlier than those outside
    % — Modulus (remainder )
    ++ — Increment numbers
    -- — Decrement numbers

    Comparison Operators
    == — Equal to
    === — Equal value and equal type
    != — Not equal
    !== — Not equal value or not equal type
    > — Greater than
    < — Less than
    >= — Greater than or equal to
    <= — Less than or equal to
    ? — Ternary operator

    Logical Operators
    && — Logical and
    || — Logical or
    ! — Logical not

    Bitwise Operators
    & — AND statement
    | — OR statement
    ~ — NOT
    ^ — XOR
    << — Left shift
    >> — Right shift
    >>> — Zero fill right shift

## VOCABULAY
JavaScript - a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.  (Not Java - an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform.)

conditionals - supported logical conditions from mathematics

operators - a symbol used to perform operations

data types - an immutable value ([its complicated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures))

variable - a placeholder for a data type
