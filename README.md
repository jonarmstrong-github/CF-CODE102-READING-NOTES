# CODE FELLOWS - SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

Welcome to the repository where I store my digital class notes for Code Fellows.  Below you will find navigation organized by day and class.  Along with my notes personal I have attempted to keep track of the adgenda outlined by Code Fellows and vocabulay they have recommended.  You will also find useful links that have been provided to me and others that I have found useful.  Sometimes I will journal about problems I have enountered and hopefully resolutions.
