    - Recap: Discussion Reading
1. Discussion Reading
    - Read 08: Operators and Loops
1. Computer Loops
    - Demo: while and for loops
    - Truth Tables
    - Lab: Loop the Loop!

## NOTES

### Conditional Statements
    `if` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
    `else` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
    `else if` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

### Operator placement matters to what will be performed first and stored first

    let x = 3;
    const y = x++;

    console.log(`x:${x}, y:${y}`);

    // expected output: "x:4, y:3"
    
    let a = 3;
    const b = ++a;

    console.log(`a:${a}, b:${b}`);

    // expected output: "a:4, b:4"

## LINKS

## VOCABULAY
loop - loops run the same code over and over again with a different value.

for - a statement that will repeat until false (or a specific number of times)

while - a statement that will repeat until true (runs forever until satisfied)

condition - conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

increment - an operator (++) that adds one to its operand and returns a new value.

decrement - an operator (--) that subtracts one to its operand and returns a new value.

## LEARNING THAT OCCURED AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED
