## LINKS

[Emmet 2.0 in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/08/07/emmet-2.0)

## VOCABULARY

Concatenate - the combining of strings

## LEARNING THAT OCCURRED AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED

### Emmet
Today I noticed that my Emmet was working the way it worked for others.  I found the link listed above which explained some default settings and allowed me to get Emmet working for me.  Possibly a blessing and a curse.

### Quotes
JavaScript does not care whether you use single or double quotes in strings. This can get very confusing when trying to output variables into quoted text.
> alert('"'+rOne+'!" the kid "' + rTwo + ' yelled out as he jumped into his convertible ' + rThree + " and drove off with his friend's " + rFour +' dachshund."');


## PROBLEMS THAT HAVE TIMED OUT BEFORE RESOLUTION
### GitHub files
In class we were told there were files that we would have to download and start putting into our repositories.  I am not entirely sure I was supposed to do this today as we did not create any new repositories but could not find the files.
