## DAY 01 CLASS 00

## Readings Overview (Quoted from class discussions)
In Code 201, there is a lot of reading to cover, especially in the first half of the course. It’s more important to focus on concepts, and to know where to find examples in the textbooks, than it is to try to read every word.

In fact, it would be downright counterproductive to try to read and comprehend every word, so don’t even try. Be strategic as you go through each chapter:

* The pages that are dark brown are the most dense and are the most useful. Flip through the chapter until you see those, then take a closer look.
* At the end of each chapter there is a summary; after a first quick pass through a chapter, read each of the points in the summary. If there is anything you do not understand, go back and read about that topic in more detail.
* The best thing to do is to study the code examples, line by line, so that you understand what is going on.
* Manage your time. Make your time with the book productive, and not a chore. This is not intended to be an exercise in “reading it to memorize it.”
* 15-30 minutes is adequate time to skim thorough a chapter; time spent on mastery of specific details from the chapter will vary.
* Keep in mind that the ability to read and apply documentation is a core skill for developers. There’s always new technologies to learn, and you typically learn them by reading the documentation and then playing around with code samples.
