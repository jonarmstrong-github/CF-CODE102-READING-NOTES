# READING NOTES
## HTML/CSS Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
ORDERED LISTS (W/ NUMBERS)  
>```<OL><LI></LI></OL>```

UNORDERED LISTS (W/ A GLYPH) 
>```<UL><LI></LI></UL>```

DEFINITION LISTS

>```<DL></DL>``` (THE CONTAINER)
>
>```<DT></DT>``` (THE TERM)
>
>```<DD></DD>``` (THE DEFINITION)

LIST ITEM ```<LI></LI>``` (CAN BE NESTED)

## HTML/CSS Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

BY DEFAULT A BOX IS JUST BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD ITS CONTENTS.

SET DIMENSIONS WITH 
>```HEIGHT: PX;```
>
>```WIDTH: PX;```
>
>```MIN-WIDTH: PX;```
>
>```MAX-WIDTH: PX;```
>
>```MIN-HEIGHT: PX;```
>
>```MAX-HEIGHT: PX;```

OVERFLOWING CONTENT
>```OVERFLOW: HIDDEN;```  (HIDES CONTENT THAT DOESN'T FIT)
>
>```OVERFLOW: SCROLL;```  (ACTIVATES THE SCROLL BAR)
>
**CONTENT** CAN BE ANY ELEMENT IN A PAGE

**BORDER** IS THE WALL AROUND CONTENT

**MARGIN** IS THE SPACE BETWEEN THAT BORDER AND OTHER CONTENT

**PADDING** IS THE SPACE BETWEEN THAT BORDER AND ITS OWN CONTENT
(THE INSIDE WALLS ARE PADDED)

### OTHER DECLARATIONS
BORDER-WIDTH

BORDER-STYLE

BORDER-COLOR

BORDER: X Y Z; (SHORTHAND WITH WIDTH, STYLE, AND COLOR IN THAT ORDER)

PADDING-TOP/RIGHT/BOTTOM/LEFT

MARGIN-TOP/RIGHT/BOTTOM/LEFT

TEXT-ALIGN: CENTER;

DISPLAY: INLINE/BLOCK/INLINE-BLOCK/NONE;

VISIBILITY: VISIBLE/HIDDEN;

BORDER-IMAGE (PAGE 319)

BOX-SHADOW (PAGE 320)

BORDER-RADIUS (ROUNDED CORNERS PG 321)

BORDER-RADIUS (ELLIPTICAL SHAPES PG 322)

## JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS OR STATEMENTS.

A STATEMENT IS A LINE OF CODE.

```{}``` DEFINE A CODE BLOCK.

```/* WRITE MULTI-LINE COMMENTS */```

```// WRITE SINGLE LINE OR INLINE COMMENTS```

VARIABLES STORE DATA

```LET VARIABLE;```

```CONST VARIABLE;```

~~```VAR VARIABLE;```~~  (ANTIQUATED)

VARIABLE = A NUMBER, STRING, BOOLEAN, ARRAY, OBJECT, UNDEFINED, NULL

= IS AN ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR HERE

## JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

### SWITCH STATEMENTS
A SWITCH STATEMENT STARTS WITH A VARIABLE CALLED A SWITCH VALUE.

FASTER THAN IF ELSE.

DEFAULT OPTION RUNS LIKE ELSE IF NONE OF THE CASES MATCH.

### TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING
IF YOU USE A DATATYPE JAVASCRIPT DID NOT EXPECT, IT TRIES TO MAKE SENSE OF THE OPERATION RATHER THAN REPORT THE ERROR.

### TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
DUE TO TYPE COERCION, EVERY VALUE IN JAVASCRIPT CAN BE TREATED AS IF IT WERE TRUE OR FALSE.  EEP.

### CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE
TRUTHY VALUES CAN HELP CHECK FOR THE EXISTENCE OF AN ELEMENT AS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT EXISTS WILL RETURN A TRUTHY VALUE (NOT NAN).

UNARY OPERATOR - RETURNS A RESULT WITH JUST ONE OPERAND.

STRICT EQUALITY OPERATORS RESULT IN FEWER UNEXPECTED VALUES THAN OTHER OPERATORS.

### SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES
LOGICAL OPERATORS SHORT CIRCUIT (STOP) AS SOON AS THEY HAVE A RESULT.
THIS TECHNIQUE CAN ALSO BE USED TO CHECK FOR THE EXISTENCE OF ELEMENTS ON A PAGE.
