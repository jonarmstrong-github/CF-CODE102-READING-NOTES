# CODE FELLOWS - CODE 201

## DAY 04 CLASS 04


### [HOME](README.md)

## AGENDA
1.  Javascript Functions; Pair Programming
1.  Encapsulate logic in functions

## READING
### From the Duckett HTML book:
* Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
* Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)

### From the Duckett JS book:
* Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)

FUNCTIONS LET YOU GROUP A SERIES OF STATEMENTS TOGETHER TO PERFORM A SPECIFIC TASK.

CALLING - ASKING A FUNCTION TO DO ITS JOB

PARAMETERS - INFORMATION PASSED TO A FUNCTION

RETURN VALUE - THE ANSWER FROM THE FUNCTION (IF ONE WAS EXPECTED).

DECLARING A NAMED FUNCTION
>```FUNCTION NAME(PARAMETERS IF ANY ARE NEEDED){```
>
>  ```THE TASKS TO BE PERFORMED;```
>
> ```RETURN VALUE;```
> 
>```}``` (NO SEMI-COLON)

CALLING A NAMED FUNCTION 
> ```NAME(PARAMETERS IF ANY ARE NEEDED);```

ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS (FUNCTION EXPRESSION)
> ```LET VARIABLE = FUNCTION(PARAMETERS){TASK;};```
>
> (THAT LAST SEMI-COLON CLOSES THE CREATION OF THE VARIABLE)

IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSION (IIFE)
> ```LET VARIABLE = (FUNCTION(PARAMETERS){TASK;}());```

VARIABLE SCOPE
> LOCAL (OR FUNCTION LEVEL) SCOPE - TRAPPED IN A FUNCTION
>
> GLOBAL SCOPE - VARIABLES CREATED IN OPEN SPACE

- CONTAINING

COMMON TO GROUP IN ```<DIV>```

[FIND EXAMPLES HERE](https://htmlandcssbook.com/code-samples/chapter-15/)

```POSITION: STATIC/RELATIVE/ABSOLUTE/FIXED```

```Z-INDEX``` DEFINES WHO IS ON TOP OF WHO...  X(WIDTH) Y(HEIGHT) Z(DEPTH)

```FLOAT```  (PAGE 370)

```CLEAR: LEFT/RIGHT/BOTH/NONE``` 

BROWSER MAY NOT SEE THE PARENT HOLDING ALL FLOATING ELEMENTS (PAGE 374)

COLUMNS (PAGE 376)

RECOMMENDED VIEWING AREA
> WIDTH 1000PX
> 
> HEIGHT 960PX

"ABOVE THE FOLD"  0-600PX
