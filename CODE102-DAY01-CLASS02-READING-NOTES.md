## NOTES

I JUST COPIED AND PASTED A BUNCH OF CODE INTO MY COMPUTER THAT PERFORMED TASKS FAR BEYOND MY CURRENT LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING.  THIS IS A SECURITY AND STABILITY NIGHTMARE.  WILL I HAVE CODEFELLOWS SUPPORT FOR GLITCHES/BUGS/UPDATES/SECURITY/REMOVAL AFTER I COMPLETE THE PROGRAM OR IF I LEAVE THE PROGRAM.  PLEASE RETHINK THE NECESSITY OF INSTALLING A LINUX SHELL ON WINDOWS MACHINES TO PERFORM GIT COMMANDS THAT THERE IS A DESKTOP APPLICATION FOR.

## LINKS

## VOCABULAY

CLI (Command Line Interface) - A text based way of interacting with the computer.

Terminal - The shell where text or commands are intup to the computer and output is logged.

GUI (Graphical User Interface) - A way of interacting with the computer with objects.

IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - a place where people create objects to assist in interaction with a computer.

VS Code - a high powered IDE.

Abstraction - the act of hiding information that a computer operator doesn't need to interact with the computer in the ways that they need to.

## New Shell Commands

git clone [repository link] - creates a local clone of a repository

git status - displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.

git add [filename] - add files to the commit

git commit -m “type a message summarizing changes” (50 characters or less)

git push - sends the commit to GitHub

## LEARNING THAT OCCURED AND PROBLEMS THAT ARE SOLVED

### Nested list items not formatting correctly
> You can create multiple levels of nested lists but it appears to require exactly seven characters (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content if it is going to work correctly.
>
> I have modified the Agenda at the top of the page to function correctly.  Below is an example of of my original formatting.
