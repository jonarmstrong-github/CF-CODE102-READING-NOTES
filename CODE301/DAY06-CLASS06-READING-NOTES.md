1. What is node.js?
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
1. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
    * It sounds like it is a code processor...  like a modern equivalent to compliers?  I imaging the name comes from a recognition that the The sequence of events in processing information, input,processing, storage, and output are identical to the four stages of internal combustion, intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust.

1. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
    * 

1. What is npm?
    * Node Package Manager

1. What version of node are you running on your machine?
    * 16.14.2

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
    * 8.5.0

1. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
    * ```npm install -g jshint```   will install it globally.
    * ```npm install jshint --save```  will install it to one local project location   

1. What is node used for?
    * automating the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness

1. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
    * So far my greatest experience with pair/group programming has been with my Code 201 project.  Programming together definitely helped us learn from each other (which also helped with efficiency.)

1. How does pair programming work?
    * In theory one person is driving and one person is navigating them through a task.  So far however, in this learning environment, it has been rare that the navigator has any more direction or experience than the driver and work has been more collaborative than I would expect it to be in the industry where I would expect someone more experienced to be navigating the driver.
