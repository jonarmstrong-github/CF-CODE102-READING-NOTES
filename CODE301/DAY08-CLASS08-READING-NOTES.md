## AGENDA
1. APIs
1. Retrieve and repurpose remote API data

## READING
1. What does REST stand for?
    * Representational State Transfer

1. REST APIs are designed around a **resource**.

1. What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.
    * 

1. What are the most common HTTP verbs?
    * ```GET```
    * ```POST```
    * ```PUT```
    * ```PATCH```
    * ```DELETE```

1. What should the URIs be based on?
    * Nouns...

1. Give an example of a good URI.
    * The document provided "```https://adventure-works.com/orders/1```".
    * However I was under the impression that was a URL and the article made not attempt at explaining the difference between URL and URI.  Through separate reading I discovered that "https://" is considered the scheme, "adventure-works.com" is the host, and that "/orders/" is considered the path.  Unfortunately the internet seems a little confused on which parts of scheme://host.com/path/path combined are considered the URI, URL, or URN.
    * "```https://adventure-works.com/create-order```" which has a verb in its path was provided as an example of a URI that should be avoided.

1. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
    * API that create a significant load on the web server.

1. What status code does a successful ```GET``` request return?
    * 200 - ok

1. What status code does an unsuccessful ```GET``` request return?
    * 404 - Not Found

1. What status code does a successful ```POST``` request return?
    * 201 - Created

1. What status code does a successful ```DELETE``` request return?
    * 401 - No Content
