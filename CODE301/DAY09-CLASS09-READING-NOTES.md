### Functional Programming Concepts
1. What is functional programming?
    * Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. — Wikipedia
  
1. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    * It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
    * It does not cause any observable side effects
  
1. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    * Pure functions are easier to test.
  
1. What is immutability?
    * Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
  
1. What is Referential transparency?
    * pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
  

### Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()
1. What is a module?
    * Divided up bits of functional code.
  
1. What does the word ‘require’ do?
    * The required thing is necessary
  
1. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    * We have to append ```var function = require('./function.js')``` to the file you want it work in.
  
1. What do we have to do to make a module available?
    * We have to add ```module.exports = function;``` to the exporting module.

## READING NOTES

Functional programming concepts
* immutability
* pure function

Pure functions
* don't read files.
* don't use random numbers.
* doesn't modify a global object.
* doesn't modify a parameter passed by reference.3

Mutability is discouraged in functional programming.

Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable.

Memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
